    Their take on a California Common has a moderate malt presence,
    intertwined with balanced notes of toast and caramel, finished with hints of
    rustic wood and mint on the nose. It has a beautiful copper colour that finishes
    as crisp as an autumn morning. So when your server or bartender asks what you’d like to drink,
    point at the menu and say, “I’ll have This One.” You’ll be glad you did.
